# Authentication Service

I have a number of personal projects in the queue that will require some sort of user authentication. Since each project is intended to either fulfill some need, or more likely to explore some techinical concept in a simple environment; I did not want to continue "reinventing the wheel" by building a separate authentication system for each project.

So this project is intended to handle user authentication for my own personal projects, so I can focus on what ever that project is about.
